# py-utemplate
Template for a python command line utility, with argument parsing and usage help. \
Just copy util.py to your desired place and new name, and customize to your needs.

Q: Why parse arguments yourself? Why not use argparse like normal people?
A: You have more control for complicated rules to just do it yourself.
